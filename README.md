# Confidence-Intervals

This repository contains a notebook (provided in .ipynb format as well as .html for ease of reading) which contains a study on the subject of confidence intervals aiming to explore the relationships between the different aspects of a distribution (the background, mean, associated sigma value, etc.) and to what degree of certainty we can measure these important qualities.
